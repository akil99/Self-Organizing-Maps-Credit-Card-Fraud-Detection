# Self-Organizing-Maps-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud detections using Self-Organizing Maps(SOMs)
Outlying neurons are potential frauds in the dataset.
Calculating Mean-Interneuron Distance(MID) between the Best Matching Unit(BMU) and the neighbouring nodes to detect outliers.
MID tells the neurons that are lying far-off in the neighbourhood space.
Detecting them and removing using SOMs is the objective.
